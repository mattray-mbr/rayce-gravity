            <h1>Our Company</h1>
            <p>Ski Biking is a rapidly growing sport, becoming proven as a successful blend of two fast paced sports. Riding your bike all winter on lift serviced terrain is the dream of nearly every true downhill rider. Rayce Gravity offers complete kits to attach skis to your full suspension mountain bike, using the original hardware and making no modifications to your bike, allowing it to be easily converted from summer to winter and back again. We produce kits made from top quality aluminum, with all machining and welding done in house. Kits complete with modern twin tip skis are built specifically to match many bikes produced from 2004 to current models from many top brands. Growing awareness for riding with ski edges, not brakes, is a big part of what we like to showcase. Gaining acceptance in the skiing community for ski bikes of all sorts should be on the mind of anyone who enjoys this sport. Dual suspension bikes that are ridden with your feet off the ground is at the core of our company.</p>

            <h1>Our Goal</h1>
            <p>We would like to continue to expand our selection of kits that we can offer as we progress, and as bike technology progresses. At this time we are attempting to reach the masses of downhill specific bikes and their owners. We target the grassroots riders that probably have more than a few bikes in the garage during the winter months. Generally ski biking apeals to people who enjoy riding more of the downhill spectrum of trails in the summer and are looking to maintain their skills  and have fun through the winter. Not to say that ski biking can't be fun and mellow on beginner trails for people looking for less adrenaline. These are the crowds that a rental shop with a fleet of bikes would be able to appeal to. Someone who says "wow, I'd like to try that".</p>

            <h1> Riding</h1>
            <p>With a Rayce Gravity ski kit, it's still your bike. It's still the size and feel you know. It's still your suspension, and the handling you are used to. The biggest change is having no brakes to pull. Without braking all your focus is on body position, cornering, and technique. Skiing's all about learning to turn harder, smoother and faster. The same applies to riding downhill. Confidence in cornering technique brings speed, and can certainly make the difference between being quick on the trail and being down right fast.  Before you get all bent outta shape and start thinking up eighteen different ways to rig up a brake, think about what type of braking system skis or snowboards have. Just the edges. Depending on the degree of contact with the snow the ski edges can track in any direction as well as “drift” with control.  Safety and predictability are the keys to keeping Ski Bikes accepted at ski resorts. By riding on modern, shaped skis, with metal edges, Rayce Gravity Bikes allow you to move in similar patterns as the skiers and snowboarders around you. The positioning of your body and the bike frame allows an easy leverage and precise control of the ski. The ski edges can carve a hard line, slide completely sideways, or anything in between. Think of a snowboarder sliding, rather than carving or think flat track drifting on a bike.</p>

            <h1>Bike Setups</h1>
            <p>
            Ski Conversion Kits are now available specifically  for your Downhill bike. We are always working on new designs, and now offer kits for Specialized, Norco, Trek, Kona, Rocky Mountain, Transition, and Yeti. Our products only serve modern Freeride and Downhill Race bikes. For the front end we cover many of the 160-200 mm travel forks from SRAM, Fox, and Marzocchi and a few others.  We are open for orders of up to 6+ of the same bike to allow a rental shop of stagnant bikes, to gain revenue from them during the winter as well as single orders for personal use. There are loads of 6"+ dual suspension bikes out there, and we'd like to see them continue to be used. We are always looking to expand our design portfolio. If you have a bike or a fork you would like to see added to this list, please email us. We are always open to inquiries. Special offers may be available!</p>

            <h1> Ski Resort Approval</h1>
            <p>It can't be said enough, that safety and predictability are the keys to keeping Ski Bikes of all types accepted at ski resorts. Ski biking is not a "new" sport. People have been putting skis on bikes for quite some time.  Many ski resorts are accepting ski biking as a growing sport and are starting to put their own regulations in affect. More infomation can be found at <a href="http://www.ski-bike.org/ski_areas.html" target="_blank">ski-bike.org</a>. By riding on modern shaped skis with metal edges Rayce Gravity Bikes allow you to move in similar patterns as the skiers and snowboaders around you. The positining of your body and the bike frame allow an easy leverage and precise control of the skis, making ski biking seem more like skiing than biking (at-least to non bikers) and will continue to keep the sport viewed as a positive thing for many skiing cimmunities that are also strong biking communities in the summer months. Safety, and a positive image are keys to growing the sport and keeping it available for the many who already enjoy it.</p>

            <h1>On and Off the Lift</h1>
            <p>Skiing lift serviced terrain is made possible by having a bike that will load safely on ski chairs of many sorts. The most widely accepted manner of loading a bike is to keep the bike inline with the direction of travel, of the lift chair, and simply tilt the bike backwards keeping it upright and riding beside you. Often the bike has to be held in a forward position until you leave the ramp then it may be tilted all the way back until the seat of the bike is against the backrest of the chair. This keeps the center of gravity positioned over the seat and allows the bike to rest with little effort from the rider. The rules of the Tram safety authority in the U.S. require that the bike be counted as a person. For example, a 4 person lift can take 3 people and 1 bike or 2 people and 2 bikes. Also bikes are only allowed to travel on lifts with detachable chairs (chairs that slow down through the terminal and don't travel at the speed of the haul rope.</p>
