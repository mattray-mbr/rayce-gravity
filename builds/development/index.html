                <p>Ski Biking is a rapidly growing sport, becoming proven as a successful blend of two fast paced sports.
                Riding YOUR bike all winter on lift serviced terrain is the dream of nearly every true downhill rider. Blasting turns, ripping tight lines, sending off jumps, dropping the big lines or bouncing anything that could be a jump. Building your confidence. Refining your skills. Riding your own trail, different every time or dialed in after weeks worth of runs, it’s always what you’ve been dreaming about.
                With a Rayce Gravity Ski Kit, it’s still your bike. It’s still the size and the feel you know. It’s still your suspension, and the handling you know.The biggest change is having no brakes to pull. Without braking ALL of your focus turns to body position and cornering technique.
                Skiing’s all about learning to turn harder, smoother and faster. Truth is, the same applies to riding bikes. Confidence in cornering technique brings speed, and can certainly make the difference between, being quick on the trail, and being downright FAST.</p>

                <h1> Dirt to Snow</h1>
                <p>Now, wait a minute. Before you get all bent outta shape and start thinking up eighteen different ways to rig up a brake, think about what type of braking system skis or snowboards have. Just the edges. Depending on the degree of contact with the snow the ski edges can track in any direction as well as “drift” with control.
                Safety and predictability are the keys to keeping Ski Bikes accepted at ski resorts. By riding on modern, shaped skis, with metal edges, Rayce Gravity Bikes allow you to move in similar patterns as the skiers and snowboarders around you. The positioning of your body and the bike frame allows an easy leverage and precise control of the ski. The ski edges can carve a hard line, slide completely sideways, or anything in between. (Think of a snowboarder sliding, rather than carving… Now think flat track drifting)!</p>
